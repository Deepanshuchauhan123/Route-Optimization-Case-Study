**Best practices followed**:
1. Proper code commenting.
2. Short class with specific logic.
3. Optimized data structures used.
4. Proper exception handling.

**Algorithm used**:
1. Used Bit-masking Dynamic programming algorithm to find the optimal path which return best optimal path.
2. Other Algorithms that can be used includes greedy algorithm which find the closed low cost neighbour. This algorihtm is fast but not always generated best optimal path.
3. Brute force approach which calculate the all possible path cost and then return the optimal path. It is too much time consuming.

**Assumptions Made**:
1. S3 file will be created by code and pushed to s3.
2. Constants.java file contains the S3 constants.
3. S3 file not contains extra spaces in the end.

**Optimal path**:
